= Statements

*jdbi* provides Fluent builders for various types
of queries, updates, and batch statements.

== Query

A *Query* is a *Statement* that returns a result set
from the database.

Without further configuration, a *Query* returns a
*Map<String, Object>*.  The keys are column labels,
and values are *jdbi*'s best guess at a reasonable
type.

Usually you want <<results#,more control over the returned type>>.
